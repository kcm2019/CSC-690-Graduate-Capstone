    "# AdelphiLM: A Conversational Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "AdelphiLM is an implementation of a Conversational Language Model based on Langchain library. Unlike the current implementation that just returns a link to complex questions, AdelphiLM aims to function similarly to ChatGPT, providing conversational responses to user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model setup involves loading documents, splitting them into chunks, creating embeddings, building a vector store, setting up the LLMS model, and initializing memory and chain components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll walk through the installation process, setting up the model, and running the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chain for conversational interactions.\n"

    "RAGAS, short for Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Answering Strategies, is a methodology used for testing language models, particularly conversational ones like AdelphiLM. It combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to generate responses to user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RAGAS, the model first retrieves a set of relevant documents or passages from a large corpus using a retrieval mechanism. These documents serve as context for generating a response. Then, a generation model, often a large language model like GPT, is used to generate a response based on the retrieved context.\n",

    "This approach helps in evaluating the model's ability to understand the query, retrieve relevant information from a large corpus, and generate coherent and relevant responses. RAGAS is widely used in evaluating conversational AI models, including chatbots and virtual assistants, for their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.\n"
