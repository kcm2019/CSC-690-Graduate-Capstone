# AdelphiLM: An AI Chatbot for Adelphi University

This project aims to develop AdelphiLM, an advanced chatbot for Adelphi University that can answer user queries directly, drawing information from the university's website.

## Why AdelphiLM?

Currently, Adelphi's existing chatbot, Adele, simply provides links and expects users to find the answers themselves. AdelphiLM aspires to be a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience, similar to ChatGPT, by:

- **Understanding human language:** AdelphiLM will be trained to interpret user queries in natural language.
- **Accessing and processing Adelphi website data:** AdelphiLM will be trained on a dataset of relevant content from the Adelphi University website, enabling it to answer questions directly.
- **Providing informative responses:** AdelphiLM will strive to deliver informative and helpful responses based on its understanding of the user's intent.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

- To create a user-friendly chatbot interface for Adelphi University.
- To empower AdelphiLM to answer a wide range of questions related to the university using information from its official website.
- To leverage the capabilities of PyTorch for deep learning and Flask for the web interface.

## Technical Stack

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **PyTorch:** A deep learning framework for training the language model.
- **Mistral 7B:** A pre-trained factual language model (optional, depending on implementation choices).
- **RAG (Retriever-Reader Generative Transformer):** A model architecture for leveraging retrieval and generation techniques.
- **Flask:** A lightweight web framework for creating the chatbot's user interface.
